# My Wallpaper Collection

Possibly the most common question I get from viewers of my [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/DistroTube) is "Hey, can you give me a link to your wallpaper?"  Well, I have collected these wallpapers over a number of years and have no idea where I got most of them.  I have also renamed them all (giving them a number) so I don't even have their original filename.  So I am uploading my entire wallpaper directory for those that want/need them. 

## Where Did I Get These?

I find wallpapers in a number of different locations but good places to check out include [DT](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/wallpapers) , [ThePrimeagen](http://4chan.org/wg) and Twitter
